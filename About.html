      <h3>About AtScale</h3>
      <p>
        AtScale was founded by members of the data team at Yahoo in 2013.
        They began working on the AtScale semantic layer after working on big data from the trenches – dealing with the
        basic challenges of data scale,
        query performance, metrics sprawl, complicated data pipelines and shadow BI.
        AtScale takes a highly unique approach to accelerating time to insights, enabling data literacy, and driving
        value from AI/ML and data assets</p>
